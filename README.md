This is used as a guide to help set up a YouTube account for students in My YouTube Channel class.

## To Parents:

As your kids learn My YouTube Channel class this week in Grace All-Star Academy, one thing your kids need to set up is their own YouTube account. Since we will create and upload our very first video on Youtube, we need an unrestricted YouTube account for each student.

YouTube has an age restriction policy for children aged under 13 to only watch YouTube under supervision by their parents; however, they can't upload any video on YouTube. Therefore, as parents, please set up an adult YouTube account for your kids so they can temporarily use it for the purpose of this five days class. Once the class is finished, you can take away the account back by changing the account password so your kids can keep using their supervised account.

Please let your kids remember the username and password, you can leave a note on their computer.

**Also, if your kids use their school laptop, there is a restriction that block them visit the YouTube website. Therefore, if you can, let your kids bring their own laptop.**

I appreciate your cooperation, and send me an email at jeffyuan2012@gmail.com if you have any questions or concerns.

## Equipments they need for this class:
1. Laptop (not from school)
2. Laptop Charger
3. Computer mouse
4. An adult YouTube account
